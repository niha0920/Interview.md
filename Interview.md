## 1. What is an embedded system?
- An Embedded System is a special-purpose computer system designed to perform a specific dedicated function within a larger system.
- It consists of hardware + software (firmware) that work together to perform a particular task.
  ### Components of Embedded System
  #### Hardware:
  - Microcontroller or Microprocessor (e.g., ARM Cortex, AVR, PIC)
  - Memory (RAM, ROM, Flash)
  - Input/Output interfaces (GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, IÂ²C)
  - Sensors and actuators
  #### Software (Firmware):
  - Written in C/C++ or assembly
  - Often runs on RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) like FreeRTOS, VxWorks, or bare-metal.
  ### Types of Embedded Systems
  - Standalone     	Works independently	                    Calculator, Digital Watch
  - Real-Time     	Must respond within strict time limits	Airbag system, Medical monitors
  - Networked	      Connected to a network (IoT devices)   	Smart Home Hub
  - Mobile Embedded	Portable devices	                      Smartphone, Fitness Band
