## 1. What is an embedded system?
- An Embedded System is a special-purpose computer system designed to perform a specific dedicated function within a larger system.
- It consists of hardware + software (firmware) that work together to perform a particular task.
  ### Components of Embedded System
  #### Hardware:
  - Microcontroller or Microprocessor (e.g., ARM Cortex, AVR, PIC)
  - Memory (RAM, ROM, Flash)
  - Input/Output interfaces (GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, I²C)
  - Sensors and actuators
  #### Software (Firmware):
  - Written in C/C++ or assembly
  - Often runs on RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) like FreeRTOS, VxWorks, or bare-metal.
- It’s a combination of hardware and software designed for a specific task.
- Uses microcontrollers or microprocessors.
- Often works in real-time and has resource constraints (limited CPU, memory).
- Found everywhere — in automobiles, medical devices, consumer electronics, and IoT.
- Can be standalone or connected (networked).

## 2. Explain types of embedded system?
### Standalone Embedded Systems
#### Definition
- A Standalone Embedded System operates independently and does not rely on any external system to perform its task.
- It takes input, processes it, and gives output — all within itself.
#### Characteristics
- Works without a host (PC/server)
- Uses input devices (keypad, sensors)
- Generates output (display, actuator, etc.)
- Runs a single, fixed function
#### Examples
- Digital Calculator
- Washing Machine Controller
- Microwave Oven
- MP3 Player
### Real-Time Embedded Systems
#### Definition
- A Real-Time Embedded System must respond to inputs or events within a specific time limit (deadline).
- Delays or missed deadlines can cause system failure or danger.
- Types
  - #### Hard Real-Time 
    - Must meet deadlines every time
    - Example : Airbag system, Pacemaker
  - #### Soft Real-Time
    - Occasional delay acceptable
    - Example : Multimedia systems, Printers
#### Characteristics
- Runs on RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)
- Predictable timing behavior
- Used in safety-critical and control systems
### Networked Embedded Systems
#### Definition
- A Networked Embedded System communicates with other systems or devices through a network (wired or wireless).
- It sends or receives data for coordination or control.
#### Characteristics
- Uses protocols like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, CAN bus
- Can be part of IoT (Internet of Things)
- Often monitored or controlled remotely
#### Examples
- Routers and Modems
- Smart Home Devices (like Alexa, Smart Bulbs)
- Security Surveillance Systems
- Industrial IoT Sensors
### Mobile Embedded Systems
#### Definition
- A Mobile Embedded System is portable, compact, and often battery-powered.
- It’s designed for mobility and user interaction.
#### Characteristics
- Lightweight and energy-efficient
- Compact hardware and display interface
- Often connected via wireless networks
- May run on mobile OS (Android, iOS, Wear OS)
#### Examples
- Smartphones
- Smartwatches
- Fitness Bands
- Digital Cameras
- Drones

## 3. Explain about the microprocessor?
- A microprocessor is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) built on a single chip.
- A Microprocessor is the brain of a computer or embedded system — a single integrated circuit (IC) that performs computation, decision-making, and control tasks.
- It’s a programmable electronic chip that takes input, processes it according to instructions (software), and gives output.
### Main Components:
#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
- Performs mathematical (add, subtract, multiply) and logical (AND, OR, NOT) operations.
#### Control Unit:
- Fetches and decodes instructions, then controls the execution flow.
#### Registers:
- Small, high-speed memory locations inside the CPU for temporary data storage.
#### Buses:
- Pathways that carry data and control signals:
  - Data Bus – carries data
  - Address Bus – carries memory addresses
  - Control Bus – carries control signals (read/write)
### Working Principle
- The microprocessor operates on the Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle:
#### Fetch:
- Gets (fetches) the instruction from memory.
#### Decode:
- Interprets (decodes) what the instruction means.
#### Execute:
- Performs the operation (add, move data, etc.).
#### Repeat:
- Moves to the next instruction — this happens millions of times per second.
