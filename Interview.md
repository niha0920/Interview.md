## 1. What is an embedded system?
- An Embedded System is a special-purpose computer system designed to perform a specific dedicated function within a larger system.
- It consists of hardware + software (firmware) that work together to perform a particular task.
  ### Components of Embedded System
  #### Hardware:
  - Microcontroller or Microprocessor (e.g., ARM Cortex, AVR, PIC)
  - Memory (RAM, ROM, Flash)
  - Input/Output interfaces (GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, I²C)
  - Sensors and actuators
  #### Software (Firmware):
  - Written in C/C++ or assembly
  - Often runs on RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) like FreeRTOS, VxWorks, or bare-metal.
- It’s a combination of hardware and software designed for a specific task.
- Uses microcontrollers or microprocessors.
- Often works in real-time and has resource constraints (limited CPU, memory).
- Found everywhere — in automobiles, medical devices, consumer electronics, and IoT.
- Can be standalone or connected (networked).
